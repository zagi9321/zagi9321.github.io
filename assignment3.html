    <p>The great potoo (Nyctibius grandis) is a near passerine bird,
      both the largest potoo species and the largest member of the
      order Caprimulgiformes (nightjars and allies). They are also
      one of seven species in one genus, Nyctibius, located in
      tropical America.

      Much like owls, this species is nocturnal. They prey on large
      insects and small vertebrates, which they capture in sallies
      from high perches.

      Possibly its most well known characteristic is its unique
      moaning growl that the Great Potoo vocalizes throughout the
      night, creating an unsettling atmosphere in the Neotropics
      with its nocturnal sounds.</p>

      that can be seen going across the tail laterally.</p>
