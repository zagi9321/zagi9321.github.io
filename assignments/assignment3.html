      <p>The great potoo (Nyctibius grandis) is a near passerine bird,
        both the largest potoo species and the largest member of the
        order Caprimulgiformes (nightjars and allies). They are also
        one of seven species in one genus, Nyctibius, located in
        tropical America.

        <br><br>

        Much like owls, this species is nocturnal. They prey on large
        insects and small vertebrates, which they capture in sallies
        from high perches.

        <br><br>

        Possibly its most well known characteristic is its unique
        moaning growl that the Great Potoo vocalizes throughout the
        night, creating an unsettling atmosphere in the Neotropics
        with its nocturnal sounds.</p>

      <p>The great potoo has a large head in relation to its body.
        The eyes are also very large with a brown to yellow iris and
        has a short but broad beak. Their wings are elliptical in
        shape and the tail is elongated. The feather colors vary with
        white, gray, black, and burgundy. The tail colors match with
        that of the rest of the body with the exception of white bars
        that can be seen going across the tail laterally.</p>

    <!-- Distribution and Habitat  -->
    <h3 id="Distribution">Distribution and Habitat</h3>

      <img src="./img/Assignment3/potooHabitat.gif" alt="Distribution of the Great Potoo">

      <p>They range from southern Mexico through northeastern Guatemala
        and through most of Central America down through South America
        as far as southeastern Brazil and Bolivia.

        <br><br>

        Geographic range of the Great Potoo
        In general the Great Potoo are distributed from humid to
        semi-humid forested habitats. While this species is widely
        spreadout geographically, by comparing two subspecies, there
        is little to no variation in their appearance such as size or
        plumage. The Great Potoo is found mostly in dense lowland
        forest, forest edges and clearings. It may also range into
        foothills (up to about 1,500 m elevation), second-growth, open
        woodlands (including plantations) and is sometimes seen around
        meadows, but they always require trees-etc., for their
        camouflaged imitative perch.

        <br><br>

        In the day they are normally found perching or nesting usually
        higher than 12 meters above ground level within big trees.
        The branches they choose to perch usually are nearly 20 to
        30 centimeters in diameter. At night time, they may go to
        lower perches like 1.5 meters above the ground, from which
        they hunt.</p>

    <!-- Behavior -->
    <h3 id="Behavior">Behavior</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>This nocturnal predator is usually seen perched high above
        the ground while foraging, hawking when prey is spotted.
        After the pounce, the potoo almost always returns to its
        previous perch. Normally, during the day it perches upright
        on a tree stump, and is overlooked because it resembles
        part of the stump; this is a camouflage, not just by
        coloration, but a camouflage by the setting. The Great Potoo
        can be located at night by the reflection of light from its
        eyes as it sits vertical on a post, roost, or angled-tree
        trunk. Great Patoo's are shy and solitary creatures.</p>

      <h4 id="Breeding">Breeding</h4>
        <p>Breeding has been recorded as typically February to
          August, but depending on the portion of this bird's range
          breeding birds can be met with almost year-round. The
          nest is a slight depression on a thick tree branch, at
          least 10 m (33 ft) above ground, with a single white
          (slightly spotted) egg measuring about 5.2 cm × 3.8 cm
          (2.0 in × 1.5 in). Few details are known of the brooding
          behavior, but about a month elapses before the offspring
          is seen alone at the nest. A chick of a few days old
          weighed 220 g (7.8 oz). After about 5 weeks the
          nestling is a two-thirds version of the adult, but with a
          lighter build, paler plumage, shorter tail, and smaller bill
          with less rictal bristles. The fledging period must be at
          least 2 months. After this time span, the offspring do not
          return to the nest site.

          <br><br>

          Although the adult potoo likely has few natural predators,
          predation of eggs, nestlings and fledging is apparently not
          uncommon. Adults stay near the nest throughout the day and
          rely upon camouflage to protect their offspring. Predators of
          great potoo nests in Costa Rica have included monkeys such as
          mantled howlers, Geoffroy's spider monkeys and white-headed
          capuchins as well as tayras and collared forest falcons.</p>

      <h4 id="Feeding">Feeding</h4>
        <p>Their prey consists mostly of large flying insects,
          especially large beetles, katydids and Orthoptera
          (including crickets and grasshoppers). Bats and birds are
          taken occasionally as well. The Great Potoo takes advantage
          of the night and its natural camouflage by sitting on an
          exposed perch to wait until some prey flies by, at which
          point it darts out towards the prey and returns to the branch
          with it. Very often birds of this species will use the same
          hunting perch nightly.</p>

    <!-- Conservation Status -->
    <h3 id="Conservation">Conservation Status</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Due to its large range, the Great Potoo is seen as a species
        of least concern, according to the International Union for
        Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The Great Potoo is normally
        described as "uncommon", but occurs frequently in areas of
        less disturbed forests and is often found to be rare along
        the edges of its range. The clearing of forest is the only
        conservation threat known to this bird.</p>

      <h4 id="Effects">Effects of Humans of the Great Potoo Population</h4>
        <p>The local people in the rural area of Brazil sometimes use
          Potoo as a minor food source, as they do not offer much meat
          and are hard to locate. In these areas, their feathers are
          believed to have powers to provide chastity, so they are
          hunted down for their body parts, which are used to perform
          ceremonies. It is also believed that parts of their body ward
          off seduction. Potoos fear most locals due to being hunted.</p>
