            <h3>Sketching:</h3>
            <p>My initial idea and sketch were inspired by installations done by artists and architects such as Santiago Calatrava.</p>
            
            <img src="../img/fountain/sketch1.png" alt="sketch 1" width="500"> <br>
            <img src="../img/fountain/sketch2.png" alt="sketch 2" width="500"> <br>
            <img src="../img/fountain/sketch3.png" alt="sketch 3" width="500">

            <h3>Cad:</h3>
            <p>I started off by creating one slat and patterning it 9 more times 90 degrees both horizontally and vertically, increasing the length of each slat.</p>

            <img src="../img/fountain/cad1.png" alt="single slat" width="500"> <br>
            <img src="../img/fountain/cad2.png" alt="all slats" width="500">

            <p>I then created the circular base from my sketches. I realized two problems, however. One, the first slat was lying flat against the base, and two, the slats were all floating. I fixed that by removing the first slat and grounding all of the slats to the base.</p>

            <img src="../img/fountain/cad3.png" alt="base" width="500"> <br>
            <img src="../img/fountain/cad4.png" alt="lofts" width="500">

            <p>The circular base was a little boring, however, so I swapped it for a triangular one, which I think fits the mood of the piece a bit better.</p>

            <img src="../img/fountain/cad5.png" alt="triangular base" width="500">

            <h3>Rendering:</h3>
            <p>I was satisfied with the model, so I brought it into blender to add materials and lighting. Since this was supposed to be a fountain, I added some water as well.</p>
